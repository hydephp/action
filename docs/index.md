<p class="lead">
This GitHub Action builds and optionally deploys your HydePHP project.
</p>

## Usage

This action is available on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-hydephp-site),
and can be used in a few ways depending on your needs.

### Basic Usage

Here is a quick sample workflow to get you started. It will automatically build your HydePHP site
when you push to your repository, and then upload the compiled site as a workflow artifact.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hydephp/action@master
```

### Deployment options

This action not only builds your site, but it can also deploy it for you. Here are the various
deployment options supported by the action:

### Artifact upload

By default, the action will "deploy" your site by uploading it as a workflow artifact. This is useful
if you want to customize the actual deployment process in a separate job, or if you just want to download
the compiled files manually.

```yaml
- uses: hydephp/action@master
  with:
    deploy: artifact # This is already the default, but it's here for clarity.
```

You can also enable artifact uploading in addition to another deployment method with the `upload-artifact` input:

```yaml
- uses: hydephp/action@master
  with:
    deploy: pages
    upload-artifact: true
```

### GitHub Pages (Direct deployment)

>warning This method depends on [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages), which is currently in public beta.

You can also deploy the compiled site directly to GitHub Pages, by setting the `deploy` input to "pages".

```yaml
- uses: hydephp/action@master
  with:
    deploy: "pages"
```

You also need to make sure that your GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" and that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has the `id-token: write` and `pages: write` permissions.

You can set the permissions using the following code, added to the `jobs.<job_id>.permissions` section of your workflow file:

```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pages: write
    id-token: write
```

## Supported repository structures

The action works for both full HydePHP projects and "anonymous" projects containing only Markdown/Blade source files.
The strategy used is automatically determined by the action, depending on the contents of the repository.

Both strategies require that the source files are located in the root directory of the repository.
They both also support reading configuration from the `hyde.yml` file in the root directory.

### Full HydePHP Projects

The full HydePHP project strategy works by installing the project's composer dependencies.

This is the recommended setup for most projects, as allows you to use project directories, like additional Composer dependencies,
the full configuration suite, custom code in the app directory, as well as custom views in the `resources` directory, and more.

This strategy is enabled when the project contains a `composer.json` file in the root directory.

Here is an example of a repository tree that would be built using this strategy:

```tree
├── _media
|── _pages
|── _posts
|── app
|── config
|── resources
|── composer.json
|── package.json
|── tailwind.config.js
└── webpack.mix.js
```

You can also see this test repository where the tree was taken from: [`hyde-staging/github-action-test-project-1`](https://github.com/hyde-staging/github-action-test-project-1)

### Anonymous Projects

The anonymous project strategy works by creating a new HydePHP project and then copying the source files into it.
This is done when the project does not contain a `composer.json` file in the root directory.

This strategy is great for simple projects that just contain basic pages and that don't require any additional dependencies.
This documentation site, for example, is built using this strategy, and only contains a single `docs/index.md` file and a `hyde.yml` config file.
The Torchlight syntax highlighting is enabled automatically by supplying the `env-torchlight-token` secret input.

Here is an example of a repository tree that would be built using this strategy:

```tree
├── _media
│   └── app.css
├── _pages
│   ├── 404.blade.php
│   └── index.blade.php
└── _posts
    └── hello-world.md
```

You can also see this test repository where the tree was taken from: [`hyde-staging/github-action-test-project-2`](https://github.com/hyde-staging/github-action-test-project-2)
