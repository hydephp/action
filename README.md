## About

The HydePHP Site Builder Action is a GitHub Action you can use in your Actions Workflow and that takes care building and deploying of HydePHP projects. It can upload the site as a workflow artifact or deploy directly to GitHub Pages.

The action can be used with full HydePHP projects or anonymous projects containing only Markdown/Blade source files. The strategy used is automatically determined by the action depending on the contents of the repository.

## Usage

### Basic

The following example shows the most basic usage of the action. It will build the site and upload the result as a workflow artifact.

```yaml
name: Build HydePHP Site
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hydephp/action@master
```

The artifact will be uploaded as `build` and can be downloaded from the workflow run, or in a subsequent workflow step for custom deployment.

### With Deployment

The following example shows how to deploy the site to GitHub Pages. The action will build the site and deploy directly to GitHub Pages.

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy HydePHP Site
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hydephp/action@master
        with:
          deploy: "pages"
```

Note that the GitHub token must have the proper permissions. You also need to configure your repository to use GitHub Pages using the Actions workflow.

### With Custom Configuration

There are a few more configuration options available, that can be supplied to the action using the `with` keyword.
